=head1 NAME

Tk::LockDisplay - Create modal dialog and wait for a password response.

=for pm Tk/LockDisplay.pm

=for category Screensavers, Popups and Dialogs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

S<    >I<$lock> = I<$parent>-E<gt>B<LockDisplay>(I<-option> =E<gt> I<value>, ... );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This widget fills the display with a screensaver-like animation, makes
a global grab and then waits for the user's authentication string,
usually their password.  Until the password is entered the display
cannot be used: window manager commands are ignored, etcetera. Note, X
server requests are not blocked.

Password verification is perforemd via a callback passed during widget
creation.

While waiting for the user to respond, B<LockDisplay> sets a global
grab.  This prevents the user from interacting with any application in
any way except to type characters in the LockDisplay entry box.  See
the B<Lock()> method.

The following option/value pairs are supported:

=over 4

=item B<-authenticate>

Password verification subroutine - it's passed two positional
parameters, the username and password, and should return 1 if success,
else 0.

=item B<-animation>

A string indicating what screensaver plugin to use, or 'none' to
disable the screensaver.  Supplied plugins are 'lines' (default) and
'counter', which reside in the directory .../Tk/LockDisplay.  You can
drop a plugin of your own in that directory - see the section Plugin
Format below for details.  You can also supply your own animation
subroutine by passing a B<CODE> reference.  The subroutine is passed a
single parameter, the canvas widget reference, which you can use to
draw upon as you please.

=item B<-animationinterval>

The number of milliseconds between calls to the screen saver animation
code.  Default is 10 milliseconds.

=item B<-hide>

How many seconds of display inactivity before hiding the password
entry widget and canvas title text. Default is 10 seconds.

=item B<-text>

Title text centered in canvas.

=item B<-foreground>

Title text color.

=item B<-background>

Canvas color.

=item B<-debug>

Set to 1 allows a <Double-1> event to unlock the display.  Used while
debugging your authentication callback.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<$lock-E<gt>B<Lock>;>

This method locks the display and waits for the user's authentication data.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

I<$lock> = I<$mw>-E<gt>B<LockDisplay>(-authenticate =E<gt> \&check_pw);

sub check_pw {

    # Perform AFS validation.

    my($user, $pw) = @_;

    system "/usr/afsws/bin/klog $user " . quotemeta($pw) . " 2> /dev/null";
    if ($? == 0) {
	exit;         # success
    } else {
	return 0;     # failure
    }

} # end check_pw

=head1 PLUGIN FORMAT

Refer to the "counter" plugin file .../Tk/LockDisplay/counter.pm for
details on the structure of a LockDisplay animation plugin.

=head1 HISTORY

=over 4

=item Version 1.0

    Beta Release.

=item Version 1.1

    . Implement plugins and other fixes suggested by Achim Bohnet.  Thanks!
    . Allow plugin name 'none' to disable screensaver.  Thanks Roderick Anderson!
